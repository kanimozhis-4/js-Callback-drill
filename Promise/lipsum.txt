The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of amber and crimson as the waves lapped gently against the shore. A cool breeze carried the scent of salt and seaweed, mingling with the faint melody of distant seagulls. Footsteps imprinted the damp sand, only to be washed away moments later by the tide, leaving no trace of their fleeting presence. In the stillness, time felt suspended, as if the world paused to revel in its own beauty, the soft hum of nature weaving a story that only the heart could understand.
